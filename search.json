    "text": "I’m currently a graduate student in the Geoinformatics Master’s Program at Hunter College, where I’ve been building skills in GIS and coding. For this project, I wanted to combine those skills with something I’m genuinely passionate about: skiing. As an avid skier who loves exploring new mountains across the Northeast, I created Ski The NorthEast as a way to bring together geographic insight and useful planning tools for fellow skiers and snowboarders.\nOne question I often hear — and ask myself — is: Where should I go for my next weekend ski trip? Should I visit a new mountain? What’s the surrounding town like? To help answer those questions, this project merges information about medium to large ski mountains in New York, Vermont, and New Hampshire with demographic data from the U.S. Census. By integrating stats like population, age, and income for the counties near each resort, Ski The NorthEast offers a broader picture of not just where to ski, but what kind of experience to expect off the slopes."

    "text": "My name is Caroline Maramara\nI’m currently a graduate student in the Geoinformatics Master’s Program at Hunter College, where I’ve been building skills in GIS and coding. For this project, I wanted to combine those skills with something I’m genuinely passionate about: skiing. As an avid skier who loves exploring new mountains across the Northeast, I created Ski The NorthEast as a way to bring together geographic insight and useful planning tools for fellow skiers and snowboarders.\nOne question I often hear — and ask myself — is: Where should I go for my next weekend ski trip? Should I visit a new mountain? What’s the surrounding town like? To help answer those questions, this project merges information about medium to large ski mountains in New York, Vermont, and New Hampshire with demographic data from the U.S. Census. By integrating stats like population, age, and income for the counties near each resort, Ski The NorthEast offers a broader picture of not just where to ski, but what kind of experience to expect off the slopes."
